# ProjetBI
This code is part of a school project in the field of Business Intelligence.
It is aimed to request JCDecaux web API in order to collect data about the use of VÃ©lo'v (non-stop self-service bycicles in the city of Lyon, FRANCE).

This data is stored periodically on a VPS. The data is then processed through Talend Open Studio in order to fill a Data Warehouse and perform various analysis on the data.
